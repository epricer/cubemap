### What is this repository for? ###

* Shows a map of an office.

### How do I get set up? ###

* fill out the map.json file (it will auto-scale to fit, so the units are arbitrary)
* install go
* `$go run cubemap.go -port [desired port]`

### TODO ###
* this project was originally written in 2004, and hasn't really been updated since (except porting it to 'go'). It should make use of modern idioms, and probably something like jquery to simplify the code. 
* remove the cruft of the past 13 years as this has been passed around.
